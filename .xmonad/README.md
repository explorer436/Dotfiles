Before trying to use xmonad, make sure that the following are installed:
1. xmonad
2. xmonad-contrib
3. xterm (This is the default terminal that xmonad will look for. If you do not want to use it and want to use some other terminal instead, make sure that the config file is updated to look for that particular terminal instead of looking for xterm. If not, xmonad will not be able to launch a terminal with the default key combination).
4. dmenu

Additional helpful packages:
1. picom
2. variety
