"What vim color schemes are installed?
"You can find your installed vim colorscheme files in 
"the colors subdirectory of your vim installation directory. 
"All the files end with the file extension .vim, 
"and begin with the name of the colorscheme. 
"In Linux, these are usually found here : /usr/share/vim/vim72/colors"
"The location might be different in Windows machines.

"------------------------------
" If Vim keeps complaining about not finding the color scheme at start-up,
" copy the gruvbox.vim file to Vim colors file.

" In Linux, it is usually at /usr/share/vim/vim82/colors
" In Linux, follow one of these two approaches.
" 1. Get gruvbox plug-in using a plugin manager; Go to /home/explorer436/.vim/plugged/gruvbox/colors/" and run this command: cp gruvbox.vim /usr/share/vim/vim82/colors
" Or just download the plugin from a browser and then copy the file from the
" downloaded folder to vim's colors folder.
